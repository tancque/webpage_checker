# webpage_checker
Script that checks for changed webpages bij testing for a substring in the body part of the html. 


Written in Python3, uses beautifulsoup. To install beautifulsoup use the command:
pip install beautifulsoup4

add the url of the sites you want to test to the config file, 1 url per line. The script will add a teststring to the
line at first test of the url.
